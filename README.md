## Key Learning Points
- **Encapsulation:** Used private fields and getter/setter methods.
- **Inheritance:** Shared properties and methods between classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Executed overridden methods using parent references.
- **Abstraction:** Implemented abstract classes and interfaces.
- **Collections:** Stored and manipulated groups of data efficiently.
- **Exception Handling:** Managed runtime errors gracefully.
- **JDBC:** Connected Java programs with databases to perform CRUD operations.

## Git Commands Practiced

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch
git checkout -b new_branch
git merge new_branch
git push origin main

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Java 17
- Git Bash
- VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA
- MySQL
- Command Line Interface (CLI)

---

## Future Learning Goals
- Practice more on multithreading and concurrency.
- Build a complete CRUD project using JDBC.
- Explore Spring Boot for backend development.
